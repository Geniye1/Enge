# Enge
The new hit modern game engine that will put Unreal Engine to shame

Have you ever looked at the Unreal Engine or Unity or Godot or Gamemake Studio or the LOVE framework and thought to yourself, "What if this was shit?" 
Well you've come to the right place!

Enge is my attempt at making a whole-ass game engine - that includes the whole shebang like an Editor window (wow!), a viewport (wow so unique!), animations, 
game views, hierarchies, file explorers, etc etc etc you know how it is.

At the moment, imma keep it a buck with you chief, its a bit shit. You can run around and shit but like thats about it. 

# What im doing to make it not shit

I'm glad(ha) you asked! 

* Add Docked Dear imGui
* File explorer
* Properties panel (totally original idea)
* In-engine text editor for programming

This ones gonna be a bitch I don't even know if imGui does this but you know what fuck you I want to do it so I will do it no matter how much code I have to
copy and paste

* Fish cooker

This is just to rival KFC's console

* Ability to build projects into exe's
* PBR lighting system

Listen it's like 12AM that's all I can think of, if I can muster the strength to revisit this README I'll update it but that probably won't happen. Who knows, 
the engine may be fully complete and you may be very very confused reading this and if that is the case, do not tell me because I simply won't care lmao

Also I am aware that most of the project is comprised of C even though it's not written in C its the Third Party libraries like GLFW and shit idc bro the thing
is I want to be able to build this summabitch on other machines and how am I supposed to do that when I don't also keep the third party libraries? What you want me
to redownload them like a normale human being? That's fuckin hilarious alright get the fuck outta here
